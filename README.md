# character_prediction
You write a character, and this guy can guess whar you have written...<br/>
Unless you have a really bad handwriting... Then it's your fault<br/><br/>
Dataset: NIST (https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19)<br/>
This code is trained with only 70000 images; accuracy acheived: 91%(around)<br/>
The NIST dataset is much larger than that. You can train it fully for yourself to get better results...
