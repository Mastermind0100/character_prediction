# Character Predictor
You write something and this guy can guess which character you have written...<br/>
Unless you have a really bad handwriting... Then it's your fault<br/><br/>
Code Written using: [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) backend in Python language<br/>
Dataset: [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19)<br/>
This code is trained with only 70000 images; accuracy acheived: 91%(around)<br/>
The NIST dataset is much larger than that. You can train it fully for yourself to get better results...<br/><br/>
PS: The .h5 file of trained weights uploaded here is only trained for Captial Alphabets of the English Alphabet<br/>
PPS: Further testing shows that this code can go up to 97% and even further, on increasing the quantity of data used for training
